# matrix-calculator-2x2
I will remake this once I figure out how to dynamically create matrices, for now im limited to typing out the bounds of a matrix by hand
and so this calcualtor only works for 2x2 matrices

# installation
mkdir src

cp main.rs src/

cargo build

cp target/debug/matrix4 matrixcalc.exe
